I am a research ecologist working on intertidal,subtidal, habitats, mostly rocky reefs and kelp forests, and on tidal salt marshes. I've conducted research on the population biology of sea urchins on both the west and east coasts of North America. This work includes a long-term ( beginning in 1991) study of red and purple sea urchin settlement along the California coast from Fort Bragg in Mendocino county to San Diego County with study sites along the Santa Barbara coast and on the Santa Barbara Channel Islands.  My work includes studies to assess the impacts of a large nuclear power plant (the San Onofre Nuclear Generation Stations Units 2 and 3 - SONGS Units 2 and 3) on kelp forest habitats offshore of the power plant and to oversee the performance of measures to mitigate these impacts.
